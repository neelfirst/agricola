Q-table for SFG (Solo Family Game) Agricola

state/action table

State includes harvest countdown clock, revealed action spaces with available resources
Action includes all available action spaces

States run the risk of being interminable...
- 12 permanent spaces + 14 revealed spaces = 26 spaces
- accumulating spaces can have a variable number of resources on them
- order of actions is important, so turn count is a variable
- harvest countdown clock or something of that nature is essential
- the player's board state
- the player's resource count

Real players use heuristics to narrow the number of states to consider...
this should be the comparative aspect of the study - brute force RL vs heuristic RL - compare speed/performance

State set: game state + player state
player state = board state + resource state
game state = available spaces + resources on spaces

available spaces - basically 26-bit binary, unless we get smart about actions affecting available spaces
resources on spaces - wood (14), clay (14), reed (14), fish (14), sp+food (14), stone (10), stone (5), sheep (14), boar (7), cow (5). 14^6 x 10 x 5 x 7 x 5 (13 billion)
resource state - wood, clay, reed, stone, sheep, boar, cow, food, grain, veggies. see above for ROM
board state - rooms, fields, fence configurations - this would be hard, but actually the smallest brute force state set

Q-table approach is infeasible with this many states. it would really just take forever.

so 3 problems to solve
1. how to efficiently code available spaces
2. how to efficiently code board state
3. how to efficiently code resource states

game spaces can be reduced to 32 states, but still unclear how actions affect available spaces
round 1: 4 possibilities (4C1)
round 2: 6 possibilities (4C2)
round 3: 4 possibilities (4C3)
round 4: 1 possibility
r-5-6-7: 3-3-1
r-8-9-10-11-12-13-14: 2-1-2-1-2-1-1

these are summed to 32, not multiplied, since looking backward there is only one state
still need to encode actions efficiently - since order matters, we are looking at SUM[(12+r)Pn] where r is round # and n is number of actions
perhaps we can encode 'dependent actions' - those that require other actions to take before becoming available
can we just say "current round - you cannot choose your previous action/s"? to avoid the tuple permutation scenario?
perhaps another state variable containing the set of closed actions that is not part of the Q-table
(in a multiagent scenario, if a desirable action keeps being taken, we can add it to the value of the action, thus learning from others what is valuable)
so now the action set is 26 and the available space set is 32, and we have a static set (cleared every Round) containing invalid actions (that do not incur penalties)

the player board is a 3x5 grid, with two spaces fixed as rooms
rooms can only be built next to other rooms, fields can start anywhere but also must be adjacent, same with pastures, stables can go anywhere
a space on the player board can have 5-6 states
1 - unused | 2 - room (wood/clay/stone) | 3 - field (clear/grain/veggie) | 4 - unfenced stable | 5 - pastured | 6 - pastured and stabled
it's probably best to just dynamically provide valid moves on player board as they come up
so when field 1 is built - can choose from any of the 13 available spaces, but when field 2 is built, only 2-4 choices
still, how many player board configurations can there be - throughout the course of a game? - quite a lot

choosing configurations (and major improvements for that matter) add to the action list!

rooms - * indicates preferred orientations
2 rooms - 1 configuration
3 rooms - 3 configurations (line*, L*, half-T*)
4 rooms - 5 configurations (tall L*, long L, long-half-T, box*, side-T)
5 rooms - 5 configurations (C, L*, box-stub*, T, long-half-T, long-L)

we can apply heuristics here to reduce the state space, since it's family game and doesn't really matter
2 rooms - 1 config | 3 rooms - 1 (line) config | 4 rooms - 1 (L) config | 5 rooms - 1 (LL) config
fields follow a fixed eastern wing pattern, with the sixth field contesting with pastures

but is this the right way to go? do we effectively want to force the computer to build fences only once? that is a heuristic application as well...

no real progress in a while: need to simplify approach
1) build a tool to play solo family agricola
2) play it manually, check for bugs
3) then plug in an agent with a dynamic Q-table

- this forces us to build the game infrastructure that an agent can meaningfully interact with

environment
- game board
	- round #
	- available actions
	- # resources
- player board
	- encode squares and lines
- player resources
	- the big 10
	- # players
	- fences / stables
- action history

struct actionId {
	uint8_t round;
	uint8_t move_number;
	uint8_t action_code;
};

struct resource {
	uint8_t wood, clay, reed, stone, sheep, boar, cow, grain, veg, food;
};

class env {
	public:
		common game_board;
		player player_board;
		list <actionId> history;
};

class common {
	public:
		uint8_t round;
		bool is_harvest;
		list actions[26]; // 100?
		list resources[10]; // roll in?
	private:
		void update(actionId);
};

class player {
	public:
		resource resources;
		uint8_t fences, stables; // finite
		uint8_t peoples; // 2-5
};
